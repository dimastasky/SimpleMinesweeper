## How to play

1. Start program
2. Set number of mines in the field by inputting number
3. You will see minesweeper field and number of mines to mark under the field 
4. Input XY coordinates and claim cell as "free" if you guess that it is free or "mine" to mark cell as a mine (For example: "1 5 free" or "2 5 mine")
- First move is always safe, so you can claim any cell as "free" (For example: "1 5 free")
- To claim cell as free you should use XY coordinates and "free" keyword (For example: "1 5 free")
- To mark mine you should use XY coordinates and "mine" keyword (For example: "2 6 mine")
- To unmark mine you should use XY coordinates and "mine" keyword (For example: "2 6 mine")
5. To finish the game, you should mark all Mines, not one more or less (For example, if it is 5 mines, you shold use only 5 marks)
